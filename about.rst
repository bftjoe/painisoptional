My name is Joseph Huang. I am 26 years old. I enjoy resistance training, writing code, playing chess, and practising massage therapy. 

For massage therapy I use myofasical techniques, forearms and side lying position for maximum effectiveness.

I find Active Isolated Stretching+Strengthening to quickly increase range of motion, reduce pain, and increase strength.

I will graduate from Potomac Massage Training Institute's 18 month 600+ hour Professional Training Program on May 4, 2014.

I am CompTIA A+ Certified. COMP001020405970 Network+ COMP001020405970
