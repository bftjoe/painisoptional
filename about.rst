My name is Joseph Huang. I am 26 years old. I enjoy resistance training, writing code, playing chess, and practising massage therapy. For massage therapy I mostly use forearms and side lying position. I find Active Isolated Stretching+Strengthening to quickly increase range of motion, reduce pain, and increase strength. I will graduate from Potomac Massage Training Institute on May 4, 2014.
