* Massage therapy at Pain is Optional is for stress management, muscular relaxation, and increased body awareness. Pain is Optional does not diagnose conditions.

## Payment

* Payment is due before the session begins. Cash and checks are accepted. Credit cards are accepted, but payment must be done at booking time. Tips are not accepted, please rebook and refer friends and family instead.

## Arrival

* Please arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled start time for your first session, to allow for time to fill out any paperwork. If you are a returning client, please arrive at least 5 minutes before your session.

* If you arrive late for a session, the time will be deducted from your session and you will pay the full fee. For instance, if you schedule a 60 minute session but show up 10 minutes late, your massage will last 50 minutes and you will still pay the 60 minute rate.
